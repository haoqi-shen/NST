# ArtFusion

**AI-Powered Visual Storytelling Through Neural Style Transfer**

ArtFusion brings art and AI together — not by filters, but by neural imagination.
It re-creates any image through deep feature blending, merging the content of one picture with the style of another.

## Features

🧠 **Neural Style Transfer Core** — Extracts visual patterns from deep CNN layers to reconstruct color, texture, and brushstroke.

✨ **Artistic Control** — Adjust intensity to balance realism and creativity — your photo, your aesthetic.

⚡ **Fast & Local** — Runs smoothly on consumer GPUs, delivering results in seconds.

🖼️ **From Photos to Paintings** — Turn portraits into oil art, landscapes into impressionism, or sketches into motion.

ArtFusion isn't just image editing — it's AI-powered visual storytelling.
